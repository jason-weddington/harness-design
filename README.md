# harness-design

A learning project to understand agent harness design by building one in Rust —
intended to serve as a headless-dispatch build engine for Agent GTD, supporting
Anthropic API models (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus), AWS Bedrock (Converse API), and local Ollama models. See
[`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for goals.

## Dev setup

Requires Rust (pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`; install via
[rustup](https://rustup.rs)). Install the quality-gate tooling as prebuilt
binaries:

```bash
# cargo-binstall (one-time): https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall
cargo binstall -y cargo-nextest cargo-llvm-cov cargo-deny cargo-machete \
  typos-cli cargo-sort cargo-release cocogitto
# lefthook + gitleaks are not on binstall — grab their GitHub release binaries
# and put them on PATH (e.g. ~/.cargo/bin).
```

Activate the git hooks (every fresh clone must do this):

```bash
lefthook install
```

## Build & test

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo nextest run --workspace      # fast test runner
cargo test --doc --workspace       # doctests (nextest skips these)
```

## Backends

`talos run` selects a model backend from the environment (see `backend_from_env` in `crates/talos/src/main.rs`). Precedence: a `TALOS_BEDROCK` value that is non-empty after trimming selects the AWS Bedrock backend (Converse API) ahead of everything else; otherwise `TALOS_BACKEND` picks `anthropic` (default) or `ollama`.

- `TALOS_BEDROCK` — set to any non-empty (after `.trim()`) value to run on AWS Bedrock (Converse API) instead of the Anthropic API or Ollama. This is for work machines that cannot call the Anthropic API directly. Credentials AND region resolve via the standard AWS chain (env/profile/SSO/IMDS — no keys in source). It wins over `TALOS_BACKEND` / `ANTHROPIC_*` / `OLLAMA_*`; an unset, empty, or whitespace-only value falls through to the `TALOS_BACKEND` match. Only `claude-haiku-4-5` / `claude-sonnet-5` / `claude-opus-4-8` (via `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`) are mapped to Bedrock inference-profile ids; anything else is rejected at construction.
- `TALOS_BACKEND` — `anthropic` (default when unset) | `ollama`.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — required for the anthropic backend.
- `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` — optional; default `claude-haiku-4-5`. Used by both the anthropic and bedrock backends.
- `OLLAMA_MODEL` — required for ollama.
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` — optional; default `http://localhost:11434`.
- `OLLAMA_API_KEY` — optional bearer token.
- `OLLAMA_NUM_CTX` — optional `u32`; defaults to 32 768 for localhost.
- `OLLAMA_THINK` — `off|on|low|medium|high|max`.

## Ralph mode (`talos ralph`)

The **Ralph loop** drives an agent toward an objective by re-invoking the inner engine with a **fresh context every outer iteration** — durable state lives *outside* the context window (the code on disk, the git history, and a notes file the agent reads-then-appends), so each pass starts cold and still makes forward progress. Each iteration does exactly one unit of work; the **harness owns a git commit per iteration** (a deliberate ralph-only exception to the worker-owns-git rule). Distinct from finish-recovery (which nudges the *same* context when a gate is red) — Ralph *restarts* the context. Core: `crates/harness/src/ralph.rs`.

Two commands, deliberately **never collapsed** — get this wrong and the loop misbehaves:

- **`--gate` (inner, per-iteration):** the `run_checks` command the inner engine uses to verify a `finish(done)` claim. The harness forces the agent to loop until this is green *before* it can finish, so the tree is already green when the per-iteration commit fires.
- **`--stop-when` (outer objective oracle):** a command run via `/bin/sh -c` whose exit `0` means "objective met, stop the whole loop." This is the goal, not the per-iteration bar.

**The load-bearing gotcha (why gate ≠ stop-when):** ralph commits ONLY green `finish(done)` finishes — the harness guarantees the inner `--gate` set is green *before* it commits, so the per-iteration `git commit` (which runs the repo's pre-commit hook and is **not** `--no-verify`'d) sees a green tree. Any *non-green* inner outcome, OR a green commit whose pre-commit hook rejects it, is **reverted** to the last green commit (`git reset --hard HEAD` + `git clean -fd`, ignored files like `target/` preserved, the iteration's `PROGRESS.md` append discarded — a clean do-over) and the loop retries with a fresh context. After `--max-do-overs` (default 3) *consecutive* do-overs with no green commit between them, the loop terminates with a `DoOversExhausted` terminal (exit 20, a task-side failure like `Stuck` — not the exit-1 infra `Error`). So the pre-commit hook must be **check-only** (never a `--fix`/formatter hook that mutates — see kb-03099) and must match the inner `--gate` set. Two things must **not** be in the commit hook: (1) the `--stop-when` threshold (e.g. a coverage floor) — it's false until the objective is met, so it would fail every commit and burn do-overs; and (2) a **conventional-commit-msg** hook — ralph's commit messages are `ralph: iteration N — <objective>`, which such a hook rejects.

Example — grind an unhealthy repo up to 90% test coverage on a local Ollama model:

```bash
TALOS_BACKEND=ollama OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen3.6:35b OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434 OLLAMA_THINK=on \
talos ralph \
  --workspace /path/to/repo \
  --objective 'Raise coverage to 90%. Each iteration: run coverage, pick the single highest-value untested function, write ONE test for it, verify it passes, append a note to PROGRESS.md, then finish.' \
  --stop-when 'uv run --frozen pytest --cov=<pkg> --cov-fail-under=90 -q' \
  --gate 'uv run --frozen ruff check . && uv run --frozen ruff format --check . && uv run --frozen pytest -q' \
  --notes-file PROGRESS.md \
  --max-ralph-iterations 25
```

The workspace **must already be a git work tree** — `run_ralph` does *not* run `git init`. Backend selection reuses the same `TALOS_BEDROCK` / `TALOS_BACKEND` / `ANTHROPIC_*` / `OLLAMA_*` env as `talos run`. Other flags: `--inner-max-iterations` (inner cap per pass, default 500), `--stuck-k` (consecutive no-progress passes before giving up — progress = a git diff *outside* the notes file, default 3), `--max-do-overs` (consecutive non-green / rejected-green-commit do-overs before `DoOversExhausted` — each reverted to the last green commit — default 3), `--ralph-wall-clock-secs` (0 = unbounded; also `TALOS_RALPH_WALL_CLOCK_SECS`), `--stop-when-timeout-secs` / `--gate-timeout-secs` (default 300). Ralph is **not** run-record persisted this cut — it prints a `RalphSummary` JSON (objective / terminal / outer_iterations / total_inner_iterations) to stdout and exits: **0** `StopConditionMet` · **20** `Stuck` / `MaxIterationsExhausted` / `TimeBudgetExhausted` / `DoOversExhausted` · **1** `Error` (git/spawn/revert failure). Watch progress via the `ralph: iteration N` commits and the notes file, not stdout.

## Quality gates

Run by lefthook locally and re-run in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), which is
the real enforcement boundary since local hooks can be skipped with
`--no-verify`.

| Stage | Gates |
|---|---|
| commit-msg | conventional commits (`cog verify`) |
| pre-commit | `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `typos`, `cargo sort --check`, `gitleaks`, `cargo nextest run` |
| pre-push | coverage `--fail-under-lines 98`, `cargo test --doc`, `cargo machete`, `cargo deny check` |
| CI (scheduled) | `cargo audit` (advisories disclosed after merge) |

What the Rust compiler enforces for free (so there's no separate gate): full
type checking, null-safety (`Option`), memory/thread safety (borrow checker),
match exhaustiveness, unused imports/variables, and `unsafe` is `forbid`-den
project-wide. The gates only add what rustc can't see.

**Coverage ratchet:** the `--fail-under-lines` literal lives in `lefthook.yml`
and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Bump both upward as coverage improves; never let
it regress.

## Release

Decoupled from deploy (matches the Python projects). At a meaningful boundary:

```bash
./release.sh   # cog bump --auto -> tag -> push origin main --tags
```

## Publishing talos to the dispatch fleet

talos is self-hosting — we dispatch talos features to talos — so the binary
changes every wave. Rather than each dispatch host compiling it (slow, especially
the aarch64 Pi), the fast x86_64 dev box builds **both** arches and publishes them
to the homelab artifact host (`pi-04`); the fleet's `talos-update.sh`
(in `agent-gtd-dispatch`) then just pulls the binary.

```bash
./scripts/publish-talos.sh    # gate -> build x86_64 + aarch64 -> scp to pi-04 -> advance 'latest'
```

- **Version token.** `talos --version` prints `talos <semver>-g<short-sha>`
  (stamped by `crates/talos/build.rs`). It is a single URL/path-safe string; the
  consumer reads it via `talos --version | awk '{print $2}'`.
- **pi-04 layout.** `pi-04:/srv/talos/<TOKEN>/<arch>/talos` where `<arch>` ∈
  `{x86_64, aarch64}` (matching `uname -m`), plus `pi-04:/srv/talos/latest`
  holding the current `<TOKEN>` on one line — advanced only after both arches
  upload. Artifacts are immutable per-`<TOKEN>` (a gate-failing or dirty-tree
  build never ships; an existing `<TOKEN>` dir is never overwritten).
- **One-time cross-toolchain setup** (on the x86_64 publisher):
  `rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and install the linker
  `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu` (Debian/Ubuntu). The linker is wired in
  `.cargo/config.toml`.
- **Target override.** `TALOS_PUBLISH_HOST` (default `jason@pi-04`) and
  `TALOS_PUBLISH_DIR` (default `/srv/talos`).
