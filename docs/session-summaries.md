# Session summaries

A running, chronological log of working sessions on harness-design — this is a
learning project, so we document the *process*, not just the output. Each entry
is a 3-4 sentence summary; the full per-session write-up (process, decisions,
handoff) lives in a dated `lesson_learned` KB entry under `project_ref:
harness-design`, linked here. Append newest at the bottom; when resuming, read
the latest entry and its linked KB entry first.

## Session 1 — 2026-06-20 → 06-23 — gates, research, design, foundation

Took the project from nothing to a built v1 foundation: established Rust quality
gates *before* any code (so headless agents can run safely), ran a multi-agent
research workflow into `docs/research/` plus a ~960-entry local KB braintrust
(`harness-design-research`), then locked the v1 design — the
workflow-around-open-loop shape, an 8-tool inventory (LSP deferred), and the
run-record schema with claim-vs-verify and the Done/Blocked/Failed disposition
(`docs/design/01` + `02`). Corrected two assumptions the research had baked in
(a permission/allowlist model we don't have; a Pi-specific deployment) before
grooming three GTD items and dispatching them as a headless wave (data model +
tool layer in parallel, then RunStore). All three merged clean to `main`
(`eb8a129`) — 42 tests, 97.9% coverage, zero quality misses; one build agent even
dodged a license landmine unsupervised. **Next:** the loop engine + model-backend
trait (held for an interactive session). Full write-up + handoff: **kb-02851**.
